// Webdev A1.2.3 Creating The Labs Component: Lab1 React.js Component

// Notes: 
// (1)  React.js function components can implement algorithms that compute
//      an HTML code snippet and return the result of the computation.
//      Other functions can aggregate various snippets from different
//      components into a larger, single HTML content that browsers
//      can then render on the screen. Here the component is just returning
//      a hard coded, static HTML code snippet. Later assignments will
//      introduce far more interesting algorithms to compute complex HTML





export default function Lab1() {
    return(
        <div id="wd-lab1">
            <h2>Lab 1</h2>
        </div>
    );
}


//i had to add this export line.. why?
export {}
